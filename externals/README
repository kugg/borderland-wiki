External dependencies for the compat repository.

Usually - under normal circumstances - these packages should be installed 
separately elsewhere in the OS by the standard package managing system. This
might not be possible for more exotic ones. Therefore several methods are used
in following order; (git:submodule), OS package management system, download and
extract from URL, use of mercurial (or svn) repository.

The essential packages (like e.g. BeautifulSoup) are PRE-INSTALLED.

For more information please confer 'externals/__init__.py', which contains the
listing of all packages needed as well as the install method used. Consider
