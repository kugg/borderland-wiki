      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2998">The Borderland is governed by ten principles, guidelines for how we behave against each other as participants. These are not rules, they do not claim to convey “Truth”, but are rather a source of inspiration that you are supposed to take to you heart and interpret for yourself.

Radical Inclusion

Anyone may be a part of The Borderland. We welcome and respect the stranger. No prerequisites exist for participation in our community.

Gifting

The Borderland is devoted to acts of gift giving. The value of a gift is unconditional. Gifting does not contemplate a return or an exchange for something of equal value.

Decommodification

In order to preserve the spirit of gifting, our community seeks to create social environments that are unmediated by commercial sponsorships, transactions, or advertising. We stand ready to protect our culture from such exploitation. We resist the substitution of consumption for participatory experience.

Radical Self-reliance

The Borderland encourages the individual to discover, exercise and rely on his or her inner resources.

Radical Self-expression

Radical self-expression arises from the unique gifts of the individual. No one other than the individual or a collaborating group can determine its content. It is offered as a gift to others. In this spirit, the giver should respect the rights and liberties of the recipient.

Communal Effort

Our community values creative cooperation and collaboration. We strive to produce, promote and protect social networks, public spaces, works of art, and methods of communication that support such interaction.

Civic Responsibility

We value civil society. Community members who organize events should assume responsibility for public welfare and endeavor to communicate civic responsibilities to participants. They must also assume responsibility for conducting events in accordance with local, state and federal laws.

Leaving No Trace

Our community respects the environment. We are committed to leaving no physical trace of our activities wherever we gather. We clean up after ourselves and endeavor, whenever possible, to leave such places in a better state than when we found them.

Participation

Our community is committed to a radically participatory ethic. We believe that transformative change, whether in the individual or in society, can occur only through the medium of deeply personal participation. We achieve being through doing. Everyone is invited to work. Everyone is invited to play. We make the world real through actions that open the heart.

Immediacy

Immediate experience is, in many ways, the most important touchstone of value in our culture. We seek to overcome barriers that stand between us and a recognition of our inner selves, the reality of those around us, participation in society, and contact with a natural world exceeding human powers. No idea can substitute for this experience.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4679">1.PARTICIPATE
Unlike many traditional festivals, The Borderland is an entirely participant-driven event. The Borderland’s participants make The Borderland what it is. YOU are responsible for your experience. No spectators!

2.WHAT IS PROVIDED
A place to be, a place to poop and power. That is all that is provided for you. Everything else, including, but not limited to, food, water, drinks, extension chords, sound system, shelter, candy, art, hugs, clothing, music, dreams, medical supplies, fire safety, common sense, cleaning, loving and dancing will be up to the citizens of The Borderland to provide.

3.LEAVE NO TRACE
No trash receptacles are provided. Please take everything you bring to the event back home with you: pack it in, pack it out – every last tiny scrap. Never ever let trash hit the ground, but clean up as You go. If it is your cigarette butt, snus, beer can or decoration, it goes in your car home. Read the blog Leave No Trace - is it possible?

4.COMMERCE
You cannot buy, sell or barter anything. The Borderland is a place of sharing and free exchange within a gift economy. A real gift is given and received without any expectation of reciprocation. That said, don’t feel expected to give what you cannot or will not.

5.BRING YOUR OWN CUP
The Borderland is a BYOC-event, meaning that you are supposed to bring and take responsibility for your own cup, bowl and cuttlery. There will be many participants offering food or drinks and if all of them bring disposable utensils it adds unnecessary strain on both our event and our planet. BYOC solves this problem.

6.CARS
Cars that are not essential part of the art and creativity of The Borderland should be parked in the designated parking area.

7.PERSONAL SAFETY
The Borderland is a harsh and challenging environment; come prepared to confront and be responsible for your own survival. It’s dark in the quarry—stay safe: illuminate yourself, your bike, and your artwork at night. You are responsible for You.

8.FIRE GUIDELINES
Before starting any open fire (including fireworks, open barbecues or bonfires), you are required to make sure that total fire prohibition is not in effect. This decision is taken on a day to day basis by the local government and is non-negotiable if in effect. Your nearest Clown Police will know if this is the case.

9.SOUND
Be thoughtful of your neighbors. We have a handful of summer houses just a few 100m away. Aim speakers to the south and try to use natural barriers in the quarry to your advantage.

10.LAWS
The Borderland is a closed, private event on private land, only accessible for the members of our non-profit organization. This not only allows us to reject non-registered members, but requires us to reject non-registered members, to be able to follow the laws of a non-public event. This is very important. If the authorities find there are unregistered visitors at the event, we risk being closed down.
The event is also subject to all Swedish law. There will most likely be law enforcement agencies visiting The Borderland, and you risk being cited and/or arrested if you are caught breaking the law. The Borderland does not promote or condone the use of illegal drugs.

11.PUBLIC BOUNDARIES
The area we are using is not fenced off, so it is possible for uninvited members of the public to meander into the Borderland. If you encounter any outsider in the event area, kindly explain to them that this is a private event on private land and ask them to leave. The so called “allemansrätten” does not apply here, since we’re organizing a registered event on the site. There is a public access road that goes through the quarry, that should not be blocked. The public has the right to access this, but only for passage through the property.

12.REGISTRATION
This is a closed event and every participants must be a registered, paying member of our non profit organization to be able to attend. This is done through http://theborderland2013.eventbrite. com, up until the Friday before the event starts. There are no “tickets” sold at the gates. There are no visitors allowed.

13.CONSENT
The Borderland is a pro-consent event. We believe that consent plays a vital part in our connectivity and community. Ensure all sides are mutually consensual prior to physical encounters (ie hugging, groping, spanking); be they scent-sual encounters (ie any smelly, oily or other substances applied to the skin); or be they sexual encounters. Consent must be clearly granted from an individual who is clearly in control of their faculties enough to grant it.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4803">1.PARTICIPATE
Unlike many traditional festivals, The Borderland is an entirely participant-driven event. The Borderland’s participants make The Borderland what it is. YOU are responsible for your experience. No spectators!

2.WHAT IS PROVIDED
A place to be, a place to poop and power. That is all that is provided for you. Everything else, including, but not limited to, food, water, drinks, extension chords, sound system, shelter, candy, art, hugs, clothing, music, dreams, medical supplies, fire safety, common sense, cleaning, loving and dancing will be up to the citizens of The Borderland to provide.

3.LEAVE NO TRACE
No trash receptacles are provided. Please take everything you bring to the event back home with you: pack it in, pack it out – every last tiny scrap. Never ever let trash hit the ground, but clean up as You go. If it is your cigarette butt, snus, beer can or decoration, it goes in your car home. Read the blog Leave No Trace - is it possible?

4.COMMERCE
You cannot buy, sell or barter anything. The Borderland is a place of sharing and free exchange within a gift economy. A real gift is given and received without any expectation of reciprocation. That said, don’t feel expected to give what you cannot or will not.

5.BRING YOUR OWN CUP
The Borderland is a BYOC-event, meaning that you are supposed to bring and take responsibility for your own cup, bowl and cuttlery. There will be many participants offering food or drinks and if all of them bring disposable utensils it adds unnecessary strain on both our event and our planet. BYOC solves this problem.

6.CARS
Cars that are not essential part of the art and creativity of The Borderland should be parked in the designated parking area.

7.PERSONAL SAFETY
The Borderland is a harsh and challenging environment; come prepared to confront and be responsible for your own survival. It’s dark in the quarry—stay safe: illuminate yourself, your bike, and your artwork at night. You are responsible for You.

8.FIRE GUIDELINES
Before starting any open fire (including fireworks, open barbecues or bonfires), you are required to make sure that total fire prohibition is not in effect. This decision is taken on a day to day basis by the local government and is non-negotiable if in effect. Your nearest Clown Police will know if this is the case.

==SOUND==
Be thoughtful of your neighbors. We have a handful of summer houses just a few 100m away. Aim speakers to the south and try to use natural barriers in the quarry to your advantage.

==LAWS==
The Borderland is a closed, private event on private land, only accessible for the members of our non-profit organization. This not only allows us to reject non-registered members, but requires us to reject non-registered members, to be able to follow the laws of a non-public event. This is very important. If the authorities find there are unregistered visitors at the event, we risk being closed down.
The event is also subject to all Swedish law. There will most likely be law enforcement agencies visiting The Borderland, and you risk being cited and/or arrested if you are caught breaking the law. The Borderland does not promote or condone the use of illegal drugs.

==PUBLIC BOUNDARIES==
The area we are using is not fenced off, so it is possible for uninvited members of the public to meander into the Borderland. If you encounter any outsider in the event area, kindly explain to them that this is a private event on private land and ask them to leave. The so called “allemansrätten” does not apply here, since we’re organizing a registered event on the site. There is a public access road that goes through the quarry, that should not be blocked. The public has the right to access this, but only for passage through the property.

==REGISTRATION==

The Borderland is a pro-consent event. We believe that consent plays a vital part in our connectivity and community. Ensure all sides are mutually consensual prior to physical encounters (ie hugging, groping, spanking); be they scent-sual encounters (ie any smelly, oily or other substances applied to the skin); or be they sexual encounters. Consent must be clearly granted from an individual who is clearly in control of their faculties enough to grant it.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4561">==PARTICIPATE==
Unlike many traditional festivals, The Borderland is an entirely participant-driven event. The Borderland’s participants make The Borderland what it is. YOU are responsible for your experience. No spectators!

==WHAT IS PROVIDED==
A place to be, a place to poop and power. That is all that is provided for you. Everything else, including, but not limited to, food, water, drinks, extension chords, sound system, shelter, candy, art, hugs, clothing, music, dreams, medical supplies, fire safety, common sense, cleaning, loving and dancing will be up to the citizens of The Borderland to provide.

==LEAVE NO TRACE==
No trash receptacles are provided. Please take everything you bring to the event back home with you: pack it in, pack it out – every last tiny scrap. Never ever let trash hit the ground, but clean up as You go. If it is your cigarette butt, snus, beer can or decoration, it goes in your car home. Read the blog Leave No Trace - is it possible?

==COMMERCE==
You cannot buy, sell or barter anything. The Borderland is a place of sharing and free exchange within a gift economy. A real gift is given and received without any expectation of reciprocation. That said, don’t feel expected to give what you cannot or will not.

==BRING YOUR OWN CUP==
The Borderland is a BYOC-event, meaning that you are supposed to bring and take responsibility for your own cup, bowl and cuttlery. There will be many participants offering food or drinks and if all of them bring disposable utensils it adds unnecessary strain on both our event and our planet. BYOC solves this problem.

==CARS==
Cars that are not essential part of the art and creativity of The Borderland should be parked in the designated parking area.

==PERSONAL SAFETY==
The Borderland is a harsh and challenging environment; come prepared to confront and be responsible for your own survival. It’s dark in the quarry—stay safe: illuminate yourself, your bike, and your artwork at night. You are responsible for You.

==FIRE GUIDELINES==
Before starting any open fire (including fireworks, open barbecues or bonfires), you are required to make sure that total fire prohibition is not in effect. This decision is taken on a day to day basis by the local government and is non-negotiable if in effect. Your nearest Clown Police will know if this is the case.

==SOUND==
Be thoughtful of your neighbors. We have a handful of summer houses just a few 100m away. Aim speakers to the south and try to use natural barriers in the quarry to your advantage.

==LAWS==
The Borderland is a closed, private event on private land, only accessible for the members of our non-profit organization. This not only allows us to reject non-registered members, but requires us to reject non-registered members, to be able to follow the laws of a non-public event. This is very important.
The event is also subject to all danish law. There will marby be law enforcement agencies visiting The Borderland, and you risk being cited and/or arrested if you are caught breaking the law. The Borderland does not promote or condone the use of illegal drugs.

==PUBLIC BOUNDARIES==
The area we are using is not fenced off, so it is possible for uninvited members of the public to meander into the Borderland. If you encounter any outsider in the event area away from the public &quot;trampesti&quot; footpath kindly explain to them that this is a private event on private land and ask them to leave. There is a public access road that goes through the quarry, that should not be blocked.

==REGISTRATION==
This is a closed event and every participants must be a registered, paying member of our non profit organization to be able to attend. This is done through http://the borderland 2015.eventbrite. com, up until the Friday before the event starts. There are no “tickets” sold at the gates. There are no visitors allowed. By registering as a member are you also legally bound to the Event Participation Agreement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1333">The Clown Police are participants of The Borderland who volunteer to care for the safety of
our community. During all times of the event there will be at least two Clown Police officers
on shift. Their responsibilities and duties are to mediate situations and/or disputes between participants, provide immediate access to emergency services, inform participants about hazards &amp; safety issues, address and report any instances of non-consensual physical assault, observe interactions between participant &amp; outside agencies as needed. Please avoid the temptation to just point and laugh.

One of the clowns on shift will carry the phone with the official contact number, which has been given to the emergency services &amp; other outside authorities. The clown police have been given the authority to expel participants and nonparticipants who have committed serious offence endangering the event, it’s participants and organisation.

The Clown Police is manned by volunteers. Please sign up here: http://bit.ly/10UAAFl

The Clown Police will always be wearing their police outfit, plastic baton and red nose when they are on duty. Keep in mind that wearing a red nose when not on duty as clown police is considered impersonating an officer and will be “prosecuted” under international clown laws.

The Clown Police are here to help.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1832">QUIET CAMPING
There are designated Quiet Camping areas, one by the ocean, and one on the ledge around the quarry. These needs to be kept quiet, not only to let our fellow campers sleep, but also because they are close to neighboring private properties.

POTTIES
The toilets are north of the quarry, a few minutes walk away from the main area. These use latrine buckets and it is your responsibility to switch these out as they fill up. Remember, it is really easy to do while they are half full, but gets disgusting to do if you let them fill up. Rather switch them out too early than too late! Lids and fresh buckets are around the corner.

PUBLIC ACCESS
The area is not fenced off and it is possible for the public to get into the festival area, even though there are signs kindly asking them not to. There is also a public access road going through the quarry, that is required for some neighbors to get to their homes.
If you encounter any outsider in the event area, kindly explain to them that this is a private event on private land and ask them to leave. If you have any problems, please contact the nearest Clown Police or other “responsible” person.

POWER
The power at The Borderland is a gift from the community. This means that we are paying for it, it does put a strain on the environment and you should take responsibility for your usage.
Tips and tricks for lowering your power consumption:
· Use LEDs instead of incandescent lighting. The difference is huge.
· If you bring a fridge, please insulate it. Also, bring a cooler to be used as a buffer
(get 10 beers at a time instead of one), so that you have to open it as few times as possible. · Use newer equipment rather than old. Energy efficiency have evolved a lot.
If you plan on using more than 1kW of power, please let us know (info@theborderland.se).</text>

==Pyramid==

==Beach==
Lots of water and small rocks.  Little sand.

==HOUSE==

==Quiet Camping==
There are designated Quiet Camping areas, one by the ocean, and one on the ledge around the quarry. These needs to be kept quiet, not only to let our fellow campers sleep, but also because they are close to neighboring private properties.

==Porta-potties==
The toilets are north of the quarry, a few minutes walk away from the main area. These use latrine buckets and it is your responsibility to switch these out as they fill up. Remember, it is really easy to do while they are half full, but gets disgusting to do if you let them fill up. Rather switch them out too early than too late! Lids and fresh buckets are around the corner.

==Public access==
The area is not fenced off and it is possible for the public to get into the festival area, even though there are signs kindly asking them not to. There is also a public access road going through the quarry, that is required for some neighbors to get to their homes.
If you encounter any outsider in the event area, kindly explain to them that this is a private event on private land and ask them to leave. If you have any problems, please contact the nearest [[Clown Police]] or other &quot;responsible&quot; person.

==Power==
The power at The Borderland is a gift from the community. This means that we are paying for it, it does put a strain on the environment and you should take responsibility for your usage.

Tips and tricks for lowering your power consumption:
* Use LEDs instead of incandescent lighting. The difference is huge.
* If you bring a fridge, please insulate it. Also, bring a cooler to be used as a buffer (get 10 beers at a time instead of one), so that you have to open it as few times as possible.
* Use newer equipment rather than old. Energy efficiency have evolved a lot.

If you plan on using more than 1kW of power, please let us know (info@theborderland.se).</text>

Boesdal and the whole surrounding area of Stevns Klint is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is 80 million years old. Please don't damage the rock.

=Getting There=
The event is located at Boesdal kalkbrud near Rødvig on Sjaelland. You can get there with public transport in about two hours from Copenhagen central station (Köbenhavn H) or by car in just over an hour.

The nearest commercial airport is Kastrup, with flights to most major cities in Europe.

To get to Boesdal with public transport, the easisest way is to take the E s-train (that is, train E) from København H to Køge Station and from there bus 253 and get off at Stevnsfortet. From there it should be a walk of about 1km.

If you need to plan in advance have a look at: http://www.dsb.dk

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4129">There is no garbage collection service at The Borderland. Leave No Trace is one of our core principles. That means we are ALL responsible for trash at The Borderland, and every camp is responsible for its refuse. EVERYTHING you bring has potential to become MOOP (Matter Out of Place): tent stakes, bottle caps, ashes, wood debris, orange peels, cigarette butts, pistachio shells, rope fibers, sequins—even abandoned bikes.

Plan and prepare for how and when to recyle, bring the appropriate tools for it i.e. plastic buckets which big bags can be placed in. It can sometimes be very windy at the Borderland so unless you have a plan your trash will be spread by the wind

Also make sure to keep your camp tidy and make regular moop swaps

Read the blog Leave No Trace - is it possible?

1.PREPARING TO LEAVE NO TRACE
There are things you can do in advance of your departure for The Borderland to start your LNT efforts off right and make LNT easier when you in the quarry:

PREPARE A LEAVE NO TRACE PLAN and a cleanup plan for your camp, so you can LNT as you go and have less to clean up and restore before you leave.

REMOVE ALL EXCESS PACKAGING from everything you buy (food, supplies, tools) before you pack it. DON’T BRING GLASS CONTAINERS of any kind ... they can shatter.

SMOKERS: make a portable ashtray (a mint tin, for instance) to collect your cigarette butts and ashes.

BRING ROPE or tie-downs to secure everything in your camp, and to securely strap down your load on top of your vehicle.

LEAVE STUFF AT HOME that will break up and blow away in the wind. Don’t bring loose glitter, feather boas, Astroturf, styrofoam coolers, plastic bags, sheets of paper, string, plastic drink cups, hay bales, straw, gravel, or other such items that blow away in the wind or turn into MOOPy messes before you know it.

2.LEAVING NO TRACE IN THE QUARRY

NEVER LET IT HIT THE GROUND and clean as you go. MOOP attracts more MOOP. When you see trash on the ground in the quarry, pick it up and take it with you – you won’t see it later as layers of dust accumulate.

WEIGHT IT DOWN. Put a weight on or tie down anything in your camp that can blow away.

SMOKERS: Carry a portable ashtray (such as a mint tin) with you at all times, or put butts in your pocket. NEVER, EVER drop butts in the quarry or in public areas like the porta-potties. Help keep cigarette butts from being one of the top MOOP items!

IF IT WASN’T MADE BY YOUR BODY, DON’T PUT IT IN THE POTTY. No tampons, trash, cigarette butts, etc. Toilet paper ONLY.

BRING YOUR OWN CUP. Aways be ready to be served a drink!

MAKE A MOOP BUCKET. Cut a 3” hole in the top of an empty plastic water jug, leaving the handle intact, to use for collecting and containing MOOP. For dust that has glass, wood chips, bark or anything too small to pick up, sweep it into a dust pan and deposit in a bucket for disposal at home.

CARRY A MOOP BAG. Wherever you go, carry a small bag to collect any MOOP you find on ground. Some even customize their MOOP bags to make them a part of their daily outfit.

WATCH YOUR DISH/SHOWER WATER. This is so called “gray water”, and you should consider what
it contains before you release it into nature. Only use biologically degradable detergent, soap and shampoo and filter your gray water from food and other solids before throwing out.

BURN BARREL ASHES. If you plan to use a burn barrel, bring a shovel and metal containers to scoop up and remove any ashes.

3.LEAVE NO TRACE WHEN YOU LEAVE

LINE-SWEEP YOUR CAMP. Walk shoulder-to-shoulder with your campmates and clean your campsite in a grid pattern, picking up EVERYTHING. Rake your camp and conduct a final MOOP line sweep to inspect your space.

COMMUNITY CLEAN-UP. You are asked to join your neighbors on Sunday and Monday after the burn for two hours of MOOPing the event area in addition to your own camp clean up — pick a well- traveled area. If you need, the Clown Police can help direct you to a specific cleanup project.

SECURE YOUR LOAD! Pack carefully and make sure your trash and other items do not come loose on the ride home and litter our highways.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4211">There is no garbage collection service at The Borderland. Leave No Trace (abbreviated LNT) is one of our core principles. That means we are '''all''' responsible for trash at The Borderland, and every camp is responsible for its refuse. '''Everything''' you bring has potential to become MOOP (Matter Out of Place): tent stakes, bottle caps, ashes, wood debris, orange peels, cigarette butts, pistachio shells, rope fibers, sequins—even abandoned bikes.

Plan and prepare for how and when to recycle, bring the appropriate tools for it i.e. plastic buckets which big bags can be placed in. It can sometimes be very windy at the Borderland so unless you have a plan your trash will be spread by the wind.

Also make sure to keep your camp tidy and make regular MOOP sweeps.

==Preparing==
There are things you can do in advance of your departure for The Borderland to start your LNT efforts off right and make LNT easier when you in the quarry:

'''Prepare a Leave No Trace plan''' and a cleanup plan for your camp, so you can LNT as you go and have less to clean up and restore before you leave.

'''Remove all excess packaging''' from everything you buy (food, supplies, tools) before you pack it. '''Don't bring glass containers''' of any kind... they can shatter.

'''Smokers''': make a portable ashtray (a mint tin, for instance) to collect your cigarette butts and ashes.

'''Bring rope''' or tie-downs to secure everything in your camp, and to securely strap down your load on top of your vehicle.

'''Leave stuff at home''' that will break up and blow away in the wind. Don’t bring loose glitter, feather boas, Astroturf, styrofoam coolers, plastic bags, sheets of paper, string, plastic drink cups, hay bales, straw, gravel, or other such items that blow away in the wind or turn into MOOPy messes before you know it.

'''Never let it hit the gound''' and clean as you go. MOOP attracts more MOOP. When you see trash on the ground in the quarry, pick it up and take it with you – you won’t see it later as layers of dust accumulate.

'''Weight it down'''. Put a weight on or tie down anything in your camp that can blow away.

'''Smokers''': Carry a portable ashtray (such as a mint tin) with you at all times, or put butts in your pocket. '''Never, ever''' drop butts in the quarry or in public areas like the porta-potties. Help keep cigarette butts from being one of the top MOOP items!

'''If it wasn't made by your body, don't put it in the potty'''. No tampons, trash, cigarette butts, etc. Toilet paper '''only'''.

'''Bring Your Own Cup'''. Always be ready to be served a drink!

'''Make a MOOP bucket'''. Cut a 3” hole in the top of an empty plastic water jug, leaving the handle intact, to use for collecting and containing MOOP. For dust that has glass, wood chips, bark or anything too small to pick up, sweep it into a dust pan and deposit in a bucket for disposal at home.

'''Caccy a MOOP bag'''. Wherever you go, carry a small bag to collect any MOOP you find on ground. Some even customize their MOOP bags to make them a part of their daily outfit.

'''Watch your dish/shower water'''. This is so called “gray water”, and you should consider what
it contains before you release it into nature. Only use biologically degradable detergent, soap and shampoo and filter your gray water from food and other solids before throwing out.

'''Burn barrel ashes'''. If you plan to use a burn barrel, bring a shovel and metal containers to scoop up and remove any ashes.

==When you leave==

'''Line-sweep your camp'''. Walk shoulder-to-shoulder with your camp mates and clean your campsite in a grid pattern, picking up '''Everything'''. Rake your camp and conduct a final MOOP line sweep to inspect your space.

'''Community clean-up'''. You are asked to join your neighbors on Sunday and Monday after the burn for two hours of MOOPing the event area in addition to your own camp clean up — pick a well traveled area. If you need, the [[The Clown Police|Clown Police]] can help direct you to a specific cleanup project.

'''Secure your load!''' Pack carefully and make sure your trash and other items do not come loose on the ride home and litter our highways.</text>

About this dream
A 3 meter dome, with the inside covered by with 2000 tetrahedrical pixels... or &quot;trixels&quot;

How can you help realize this dream?
To build all 55 parts, and almost 2000 trixels, we're going to need a lot of help. We're going to organize workshops throughout the spring and summer where we get a bunch of people together to mass produce these. If you want to be a part of this, please join our facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/865389820166756/

We're going to organize workshops throughout the spring and summer where we get a bunch of people together to mass produce these. If you want to be a part of this, please join our facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/865389820166756/

== About this dream ==
Kakophonium returns! it's a 5x8 meter tent to experiment in the borderland between noise and music, a place to jam and a stage to perform.

the idea is to enable this place with nonconventional instruments as to let anybody to explore with new eyes and ears

original Ideas for instruments:
tromhulabones (aka barockring)
contact microphones to everyday objects
bicycle organ
oil drum
musical saw
theremin
random percussion

== How can you help realize this dream? ==
Bring or build more instruments (nonconventional or conventional) plan jamsessions, hold workshops, help us set up the tent, play!

We are in need of a PA, and will have limited transport from Gotland so might also need chairs and rugs

== About this dream ==

'''The Dream Radio''' is a collaborative radio, sending out important and un-important stuff like music, talk, interviews, soundscapes, radio plays, secrets, dreams, homemade jingles from our &quot;jingle booth&quot;, storytelling, news, karaoke-singing, workshops, gossip, visions, poetry and whatever you might dream off. All this will be transmitted from a wonderful radioating auto-camper breathing in good vibrations, sending them out to us all. Inside the auto-camper is a sound studio where you are welcome to join us with your ideas. Bring your FM radio to Borderland and stay tuned. To the extent possible Radios will be handed out to each camp, hung in trees and a temporary lounge space will be created around the camper for communal listening, where ever we park the camper to go on air.''

== How can you help realize this dream? ==

- Join us with your good radio ideas.
 
- If you know how to build a radio station contact Kennet Harpsøe who is the technical mind on Dream Radio.

 &quot;Heating frozen toes and lonely hearts&quot;
We'll construct a tent with a sauna(bastu) heated by fire in a closed heater - ca 10 sqm - near the beach

A cast iron heater will be in the center, with a 2 meters chimney fixed in safe distance from the 'fabric'
Bars in 100 x 50 x 3000 mm wood - poles in the same dimensions
30 bags of burning wood.
Illuminated by some LED.

Welcome to the information center at the Borderland. 
This is where you'll find out where, when, what, how.. the survival guides, maps, recycling info, neighbors, art, rumors etc. 
The project will also be combined with the recycle art project where we make art out of MOOP. 


== About this dream ==


The center for information and misinformation will be located at the house - the big open building lacking some walls. 

There will be some tables, chair or benches and perhaps some bean bags.. 
There will be questions, answers, conversations and information sharing going on but also people hanging around creating art from moop. 

If we get too few visitors we will start to spread misinformation so that people will come to visit to get real information. Other potential activities might include sending messages into space and inform aliens about our activities, daily event statistics and perhaps propaganda when it feels appropriate. 

We'll organize various types of events during the week e.g.

The Art Tour 24 July 15.00 
https://www.facebook.com/events/681910141954695/


== How can you help realize this dream? ==


If you are interested... join the group recycle art and start sharing your ideas. Yes! just throw it out there. 

https://www.facebook.com/groups/839741999420343/?fref=ts

You can help out with some parts e.g. the survival guide, the daily statistics, the Art Tour or just donate some tables and chairs..

== Dreamers ==

Welcome to the information center at the Borderland. 
This is where you'll find out where, when, what, how.. the survival guides, maps, recycling info, neighbors, art, rumors etc. 
The project will also be combined with the recycle art project where we make art out of MOOP. 


== About this dream ==


The center for information and misinformation will be located at the house - the big open building lacking some walls. 

There will be some tables, chair or benches and perhaps some bean bags.. 
There will be questions, answers, conversations and information sharing going on but also people hanging around creating art from moop. 

If we get too few visitors we will start to spread misinformation so that people will come to visit to get real information. Other potential activities might include sending messages into space and inform aliens about our activities, daily event statistics and perhaps propaganda when it feels appropriate. 

'''What? when? where?'''

Let us know of all the fabulous events you'll plan to host   

'''We lead the production of the survival guide for 2015e survival guide for 2015e survival guide for 2015'''

http://wiki.theborderland.se/Survival_Guide

There will be printed copies at the event

'''We'll organize various types of events during the week '''

== About this dream ==
We need earth for grounding - a foundation for everything else. We also need a spolid floor somewhere at the Borderland as a space for creating all the magic. This dream is about creating a space with a solid, soft comfortable floor for yoga, acroyoga, dance and whatever else we feel like holding.

== How can you help realize this dream? ==
Right now there is a good chance we can rent cheaply jigsaw flooring tiles normally used for martial arts from a volunteer organisation in Cph. Any other good ideas and money are much apprecaited.

This dream is about creating a space with a solid, soft comfortable floor for yoga, acroyoga, dance and whatever else we feel like. The floor will be flat. But you can use it for all kinds of things, like sitting, lying, standing, walking, doing headstands, or even dancing, and fighting. It is also good for sex, although often good with extra accessories such as a matress, table or swing for the more advanced.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1188">== Camp description ==
HighBearNation was founded in 2014, with 12 members who came together to create a &quot;home away from home&quot; for themselves.
It turned out that the camp also became a home and a calm place for other participants during the Borderland.

The main idea of HighBearNation is to provide a safe zone for all participants at the event and to be a break from the intensely social and active community that is the Borderland. 

While HighBearNation is supposed to be a less intense camp in itself it's members may still take up any other projects that engage them.

A member of HighBearNation is a &quot;Bear&quot; and therefore has a Bear name such as: &quot;Mama Bear&quot; or &quot;Big Bear&quot;. 

One of the themes of HighBearNation is &quot;Bear Service&quot;. Bear service is not necessarily what's best for you, but it it still might be what you'd like at a specific moment and is provided by the camp to other participants.

== How to join this camp ==
New members are nominated by existing camp members.  

== How to support this camp ==
HighBearNation is in need of anything that could make your stay on the grounds more comfortable. Such as pillows or scraps of cloth to make decorations.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="578">We’re the Queer Qlux Qlan! 
It's a brand new Borderland camp where we celebrate and explore queerness in all its manifestations: political, sexual, social, religious, and gender-wise. 

Queer is that which is odd, strange, deviant and non-normative. As an art form, it promotes a more playful attitude to identity production—beyond the narrow confines of socially approved identities. As a political practice, it encourages visibility and broader representation for non-normative people, in order to allow for the creation of more diverse identities in contemporary society.</text>

All citizens of The Borderland will provided with three things:

That is all. Everything else, including, but not limited to, food, water, drinks, extension chords, sound system, shelter, candy, art, hugs, clothing, music, dreams, medical supplies, fire safety, common sense, cleaning, loving and dancing will be up to the citizens of The Borderland to provide.

If you decide to make it so. You can list your own project and view others at &lt;a href=&quot;http://dreams.theborderland.se.&quot;&gt;http://dreams.theborderland.se.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Who is in charge?&lt;/h3&gt;
You are.
&lt;h3&gt;Can I play music/DJ at The Borderland?&lt;/h3&gt;
Yes, if you bring a sound system or find someone who will bring a sound system. Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://dreams.theborderland.se&quot;&gt;Dreams&lt;/a&gt; site and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/groups/borderland2013/&quot;&gt;Facebook Group&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;h3&gt;Who cleans up? What is this &quot;Leave No Trace&quot;-Thing?&lt;/h3&gt;
You are responsible for your own trash. If you smoke a cigarette, the butt goes in your bag, back to your camp, and in your car home from the event. The same goes for beer cans, packaging, food left-overs - everything! It is &lt;strong&gt;never&lt;/strong&gt; acceptable to think that someone else will take care of your trash. Pack it in, pack it out!

There are no &quot;tickets&quot; for the event. Instead you register as a co-creator, an organizing member of the non-profit that is responsible for The Borderland. Registration will close one week prior to the event, so make sure to plan accordingly.

&lt;h2&gt;Practicalities&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;How do i get power for my art and camp?&lt;/h3&gt;
We share power at The Borderland. The reason for this is mainly environmental reasons, as we can get green power from the grid and we don't want people to use generators in the quarry. However, this means that we will all have to help eachother out in minimizing consumption or the entire city will go down. Bring only LED lights and try to not use heaters (toaster, water boilers). Turn things off when you're not using them.

&lt;a href=&quot;http://theborderland.se/electricity/&quot;&gt;Read more about our community power grid here.&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Will I be able to leave and return to the event?&lt;/h3&gt;
You will be able to leave The Borderland after arrival. However, this is &lt;strong&gt;strongly&lt;/strong&gt; discouraged. You should try to bring everything you need for the whole event when you first arrive.
&lt;h3&gt;What can I buy once I get there?&lt;/h3&gt;
The Borderland is a commerce-free event. Selling or purchasing anything at the event is a breach of the principles and anyone doing so will be asked to leave.
&lt;h3&gt;Can I get a hold of that awesome logo for my project?&lt;/h3&gt;

The same goes for beer cans, packaging, food left-overs - everything! It is '''never''' acceptable to think that someone else will take care of your trash. Pack it in, pack it out!

'''How is The Borderland related to Burning Man?'''

The Borderland is organized by Gränslandet Ideell Förening and acting independently from Burning Man, but is a part of it's &quot;regional network&quot;, where we share philosophy and experience across the globe. Black Rock City, LLC is not liable for anything resulting from the event or associated operations.
==How do I transfer my membership?==
Any memberships must be transfered no later than July 14. [[Membership transfers|Please follow instructions here]].

=Practicalities=
==How do i get power for my art and camp?==
We share power at The Borderland. The reason for this is mainly environmental reasons, as we can get green power from the grid and we don't want people to use generators in the quarry. However, this means that we will all have to help each other out in minimizing consumption or the entire city will go down. Bring only LED lights and try to not use heaters (toaster, water boilers). Turn things off when you're not using them.

[[Electricity|Read more about our community power grid here]].
==Will I be able to leave and return to the event?==
You will be able to leave The Borderland after arrival. However, this is '''strongly''' discouraged. You should try to bring everything you need for the whole event when you first arrive. When you leave, you pop your bubble, the weird little illusion that we manage to trap your brain in inside The Borderland. When people leave, it usually takes them time to get back in to the mood when they come back, which also affects others. Put your full focus on living in our imaginary land for the whole week. You have 51 weeks a year to live in the default world.

==What can I buy once I get there?==
The Borderland is a commerce-free event. Selling or purchasing anything at the event is a breach of the principles and anyone doing so will be asked to leave.

You are responsible for your own trash. If you smoke a cigarette, the butt goes in your bag, back to your camp, and in your car home from the event. The same goes for beer cans, packaging, food left-overs - everything! It is '''never''' acceptable to think that someone else will take care of your trash. Pack it in, pack it out!

==I am a member of the press. Can I come and report about The Borderland?==
You are welcome to be a part of our community as a co-creator and participant. We are not interested in getting any press coverage of the event.


=Admission and membership=
==Who can attend The Borderland?==
To be allowed to attend The Borderland you have to be registered as a co-creator. More info on the [//theborderland.se/registration/ registration page].
==How much is a membership for my child?==
Children 12 and under accompanied by a parent will be admitted for free, those over 12 require full-price tickets. Anyone under 18 must be accompanied by a parent or guardian.
==Will I be able to buy tickets at the gate?==
There are no &quot;tickets&quot; for the event. Instead you register as a co-creator, an organizing member of the non-profit that is responsible for The Borderland. Registration will close one week prior to the event, so make sure to plan accordingly.
==Does the event sell out, or have a limit in size?==
300 memberships are released on Feb 1. Another 200 will be released at a later date.
==Where does the money go?==
60-70% of the revenue goes back to the community in the form of grants. You can check out our budget for last year [//docs.google.com/a/guff.se/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aq4VG9oXC-F8dGI0UklhaXN3ZURWNi03Y3Y0OWxEOUE here].

==How is The Borderland related to Burning Man?==

The Borderland is organized by Gränslandet Ideell Förening and acting independently from Burning Man, but is a part of it's &quot;regional network&quot;, where we share philosophy and experience across the globe. Black Rock City, LLC is not liable for anything resulting from the event or associated operations.

==How do I transfer my membership?==
Any memberships must be transfered no later than July 14. [[Membership transfers|Please follow instructions here]].


=Practicalities=
==How do i get power for my art and camp?==
We share power at The Borderland. The reason for this is mainly environmental reasons, as we can get green power from the grid and we don't want people to use generators in the quarry. However, this means that we will all have to help each other out in minimizing consumption or the entire city will go down. Bring only LED lights and try to not use heaters (toaster, water boilers). Turn things off when you're not using them.

[[Electricity|Read more about our community power grid here]].
==Will I be able to leave and return to the event?==
You will be able to leave The Borderland after arrival. However, this is '''strongly''' discouraged. You should try to bring everything you need for the whole event when you first arrive. When you leave, you pop your bubble, the weird little illusion that we manage to trap your brain in inside The Borderland. When people leave, it usually takes them time to get back in to the mood when they come back, which also affects others. Put your full focus on living in our imaginary land for the whole week. You have 51 weeks a year to live in the default world.

==What can I buy once I get there?==
The Borderland is a commerce-free event. Selling or purchasing anything at the event is a breach of the principles and anyone doing so will be asked to leave.
